The **_dsEeprom_** library is a helper lib to simplify EEPROM-access (e.g. storeString, restoreString, ...) and add some additional funktionality (e.g. CRC check, magic to identify version, ..). For further information see the README in the **_dsEeprom subfolder_**.

The folder **_SimpleLog_** contains a library that supports printf() like logging (you may specify a format-string for data output). Output is possible to every open stream. See the README in **_SimpleLog_** for a detailed description.
